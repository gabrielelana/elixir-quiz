# Elixir Quiz

Solutions to the [Elixir Quiz](http://elixirquiz.github.io/): Weekly programming problems to help you learn Elixir

> Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge. You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the problem thread [on our subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz). Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected ways.

> Programming problems contributed by the community are not only possible, but encouraged. >  If you have an interesting problem that you'd like to submit, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/elixirquiz/src/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.
